!• *Can we use many Auxiliaries in machine.cfg after all!?!*  :'D

• Updateable data packs (with reinjection of scripts and/or update scripts added!!  :D )
• Removeable data packs? :D
• Create your own data packs from a bunch of PRAY (eg .agent[s]) files 8>
	• And/or from Journal files, like Ports&Prints and if Aiko ever makes Garden Box setups exportable it'll probably be as Journal files :D
		But since Journal files are readwrite, how does that work with datapacks/Auxiliaries??
